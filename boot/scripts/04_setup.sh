========================================================================
The docker installation script stopped because of an error. This is not
a problem in the PiBuilder $SCRIPT script. It is a problem in the script
supplied by Docker that is downloaded from https://get.docker.com. You
will need to examine the output above to determine why the installation
failed. Best case is that the problem is transient so waiting a while
and re-running $SCRIPT might let you proceed. Worst case is that the
problem is persistent which MAY indicate that the cause is something
about your networking arrangements or your ISP.

========================================================================
$SCRIPT expects the docker convenience script to install docker-compose
as a plug-in at:
   $COMPOSE_PLUGIN
Unfortunately, that file can't be found. This is probably because the
convenience script has changed and is something that PiBuilder can't
control. Please open an issue at:
