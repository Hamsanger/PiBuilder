# Installing SQLite

The version of SQLite you get via `apt` lacks some features. If you want the complete release, you need to build it from scratch.

The installation script for SQLite used to be named `06_setup.sh`. It was always optional. It has been renamed as a helper script. To install SQLite:

``` bash
$ ~/PiBuilder/boot/scripts/helpers/install_sqlite.sh
```
